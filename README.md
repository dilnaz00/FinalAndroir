The main fragment shows the latest films that are currently being released in cinemas, and is highlighted with vivid images similar to the photo in the title role. The next fragment, entitled "My List", serves as a repository for saved files and contains the history of the movies you watched. In the third fragment, entitled "Overview", users can search for films that are conveniently distributed by genre.
